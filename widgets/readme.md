I keep the widgets folder to align with the FSD architecture.
In practice, since widgets consist of multiple features imported by multiple pages, they are used less frequently. When we divide features and pages by domain, the features themselves are already clearly separated.
From my actual work experience, the number of components in the widgets folder tends to be quite small.
